{"name":"ABAQUS FEA","tagline":"","body":"## A Short Course for Engineers\r\nABAQUS is a high-powered finite element analysis (FEA) software package used by industrial and academic researchers throughout the world.  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the interface and modeling through engineering exercises and physical models.\r\n\r\nThis course is not an introduction to FEA, nor is it intended to replace courses such as ME 471 which introduce programming concepts.  We will discuss aspects of FEA and briefly review the principles, but this course is strongly oriented towards accomplishing basic practical tasks which engineering students and researchers may encounter.\r\n\r\n## First Section (31 March, 2 April)\r\n\r\n## Second Section (7, 9 April)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
